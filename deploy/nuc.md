# Home-Lab Deployment (Intel NUC)

This document captures guidance specific to deploying Perfect Day on the home-lab NUC. The application architecture is host-agnostic — see `design/01-architecture.md`. Everything here is deployment-specific.

---

## Hardware

- Intel NUC 4-core x86 1.85 GHz, 8 GB RAM
- Shared with other household services
- Single machine — no high availability

## Edge

- **FortiGate 7.4:** TLS termination, WAF, virtual hosting
- Two TLS certs: one for `diary.perfectday.bdsys.net` (web), one for `api.diary.perfectday.bdsys.net` + `media.diary.perfectday.bdsys.net` (API + upload target)
- FortiGate WAF rule: `media.*` subdomain accepts PUT only (uploads); all other methods blocked at edge
- CORS allowlist on the API for the web origin; Expo dev tunnel allowed only when `ENV=dev`

## Resource budget (idle RAM)

| Service | Idle RAM |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | 100–200 MB |
| Redis | 70–150 MB |
| FastAPI (2 workers) | 100–150 MB |
| Celery worker (2 processes) | 150–250 MB |
| Celery beat | 50 MB |
| MinIO | 100–200 MB |
| Next.js SSR (Node) | 150–300 MB |
| **Total** | **~720 MB – 1.3 GB** |

Comfortable on 8 GB. Risk zone: heavy backfill + LLM calls simultaneously → CPU saturation before RAM.

## Celery sizing

Cap Celery worker concurrency at 2 for PoC. If memory pressure appears, switching to a single-process async worker (`arq`) is a drop-in option — task interface is nearly identical and cuts worker RAM ~50%.

## Storage

MinIO for photo storage. Storage path (`/data/minio` or similar) can be bind-mounted to a larger drive without application changes — update the Docker Compose volume mount.

## Secrets

`master_secret` and OAuth client secrets are stored in a `sops`-encrypted secrets file. Encrypted with a YubiKey (GPG/age backend). At process start:

```bash
sops -d secrets.enc.yaml > /run/secrets/app.env
# process reads /run/secrets/app.env; file exists only in tmpfs
```

This is a **documented compromise** — the decrypted value lives in process memory on the same host as the database and MinIO. It is acceptable for a personal/family-only deployment where physical access to the host is controlled. It is **not** acceptable for any multi-user or cloud deployment — use a managed secret manager there.

Backup private key (`age` keypair for `age`-encrypted `pg_dump`) is stored on a **separate device** (USB key, second machine, or password manager export), not on the NUC.

## Backup

Celery beat task daily:

1. `pg_dump | age --recipients-file /path/to/backup.pub > backup-$(date +%F).sql.gz.age`
2. Upload to local MinIO bucket `backups/`
3. `rclone sync` to Backblaze B2 (cost ~$5/mo for typical diary data volume)

The `age` private key for decryption lives off-NUC. Without it the backup is unreadable even if an attacker gets the bucket.

**Quarterly DR drill:** restore the most recent backup to a clean Docker Compose stack on a separate machine. Verify diary timeline, photos, and auth all work before declaring the backup valid.

## Email deliverability

The NUC is on a residential IP. Major mailbox providers (Gmail, Outlook) reject or junk transactional email from residential IPs.

**All outbound email must go through SendGrid (or Postmark/SES) as an SMTP relay.** Configure FastAPI to use SendGrid's SMTP endpoint with an API key — never send directly from the NUC's IP.

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for `bdsys.net` are required before any email lands reliably. See `design/dns-and-email.md` (TBD) for the full DNS plan.

## Photo serving caveat

All photo reads are proxied through the API (decrypt-and-stream). A typical residential uplink is 10–50 Mbps. This saturates at a handful of concurrent photo loads. For personal/family use (2–5 concurrent users) this is acceptable. For any broader sharing, consider moving to a VPS with datacenter bandwidth.

## Single point of failure

Power outage, ISP outage, disk failure, OS reboot, or accidental power loss all take the diary offline. There is no HA story on this deployment. Mitigations:

- UPS on the NUC
- External backup (Backblaze B2) for data recovery after disk failure
- `restart: always` on all Docker Compose services for process recovery after reboot
- Quarterly DR drill (above) to verify recovery is actually possible

Appropriate for personal/family use. Not appropriate for any user beyond the household.
